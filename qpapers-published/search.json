    "text": "Large Language Models and automation frameworks have enabled new forms of productivity, but they rarely optimize the cognitive effort of individual users in real time. I introduce Cognitive Interaction Optimization Platform (CIOP), a multi-domain Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to optimize human-computer interaction in real time. This is composed of domain-specific RL agents each focusing on a unique aspect of efficency like Cognitive Intelligence and Real-time Adaptation.\nThis framework had two sub components:\n\nAutonmous Command Optimization Network (ACON)\nCognitive Optimization Workflow Intelligence (COWI)\n\nThis manuscript focuses on version 1.0 of Autonmous Command Optimization Network (ACON) which captures real-time user behavior, suggests optimized actions, and adapts continuously. Initial results show that ACON reduces keystrokes and mental operations, aligning with the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). I presents an early version of the platform, with code snippets, metrics, and a roadmap towards multi-domain cognitive optimization. This version (1.0) focuses on Multi-Armed Bandit Reinforcement Learning"
