## Introduction

Documentation is the backbone of any successful software project. As our needs evolve, so do our documentation tools. If you've been using Docusaurus and are considering a move to Quarto for its superior academic publishing capabilities, multi-format output, and Jupyter integration, you're in the right place.

**Doc2Quarto** is a powerful command-line tool built in Rust that automates the tedious process of converting Docusaurus markdown files to Quarto format. It preserves your carefully crafted directory structure while transforming syntax elements to ensure a seamless migration.

## Why Migrate to Quarto?

Before diving into the tool itself, let's understand why you might want to make this transition:

**Academic Publishing Excellence**
: Quarto provides native support for citations, cross-references, and LaTeX, making it ideal for technical documentation that requires scholarly rigor.

**Multi-format Output**
: Generate PDF, HTML, DOCX, and more from the same source file. This flexibility is invaluable for teams that need to deliver documentation in multiple formats.

**Jupyter Integration**
: Seamlessly embed executable code blocks and live visualizations, perfect for data science and computational documentation.

**Enhanced Flexibility**
: Better suited for technical documentation, research outputs, and complex publishing workflows.

## Key Features

Doc2Quarto handles the heavy lifting of migration with these powerful features:

### Frontmatter Transformation

The tool intelligently converts Docusaurus-specific frontmatter fields to their Quarto equivalents:

**Before (Docusaurus):**
```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
order: 1
---
```

**After (Quarto):**
```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
order: 1
---
```

### Admonition Conversion

One of the most significant syntax differences between the two platforms is how they handle callout boxes. Doc2Quarto automatically transforms these:

**Before (Docusaurus):**
```markdown
:::note Important Information
This is a note with a custom title
:::

:::warning
Be careful with this operation
:::
```

**After (Quarto):**
```markdown
:::: {.callout-note}
## Important Information
This is a note with a custom title
::::

:::: {.callout-warning}
Be careful with this operation
::::
```

The tool supports all standard admonition types:

| Docusaurus | Quarto Callout |
|------------|----------------|
| `note` | `note` |
| `tip` | `tip` |
| `info` | `note` |
| `caution` | `caution` |
| `warning` | `warning` |
| `danger` | `important` |

### Structure Preservation

Your carefully organized documentation structure remains intact. Doc2Quarto:

- Maintains directory hierarchy
- Copies image folders alongside converted files
- Preserves relative paths and references
- Changes file extensions from `.md` to `.qmd`

### Progress Tracking

For large documentation projects, the tool provides visual feedback with:

- Progress bars showing conversion status
- Real-time file processing messages
- Summary statistics upon completion

## Installation

Doc2Quarto offers multiple installation methods to suit your workflow:

### Option 1: Cargo (Rust Users)

If you have Rust installed:

```bash
cargo install doc2quarto
```

### Option 2: Homebrew (macOS)

For macOS users with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install rvbug/tap/doc2quarto
```

### Option 3: Debian Package (Linux)

Download and install the `.deb` package:

```bash
# Download latest release
wget https://github.com/rvbug/doc2quarto/releases/download/v0.1.1/doc2quarto_0.1.1-1_amd64.deb

# Install
sudo dpkg -i doc2quarto_0.1.1-1_amd64.deb
```

### Option 4: Build from Source

For the latest development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rvbug/doc2quarto.git
cd doc2quarto
cargo install --path .
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify it works:

```bash
doc2quarto --help
```

## Usage

Using Doc2Quarto is straightforward. The basic command structure is:

```bash
doc2quarto --source ./docs --dest ./quarto-docs
```

Or using short flags:

```bash
doc2quarto -s ./docs -d ./quarto-docs
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Flag | Short | Description | Required |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `--source` | `-s` | Source directory containing Docusaurus markdown files | Yes |
| `--dest` | `-d` | Destination directory for Quarto files | Yes |

## Real-World Example

Let's walk through a complete migration example:

### Before Conversion

Your Docusaurus project structure:

```
docs/
├── intro.md
├── guide/
│   ├── quickstart.md
│   └── img/
│       └── diagram.png
└── api/
    └── reference.md
```

### Running the Conversion

```bash
doc2quarto --source ./docs --dest ./quarto-docs
```

Output:
```
Doc2Quarto - Docusaurus to Quarto Converter
=============================================
✓ Found 3 .md files in source directory

ℹ Found 3 markdown files
✓ Processed: intro.md
✓ Processed: quickstart.md
✓ Processed: reference.md
Conversion completed!
```

### After Conversion

Your new Quarto structure:

```
quarto-docs/
├── intro.qmd
├── guide/
│   ├── quickstart.qmd
│   └── img/
│       └── diagram.png
└── api/
    └── reference.qmd
```

Notice how the `img` folder is automatically copied alongside the converted files!

## Technical Architecture

Doc2Quarto is built with modern Rust practices, leveraging these excellent libraries:

- **Clap**: Ergonomic command-line argument parsing
- **Indicatif**: Beautiful progress bars and spinners
- **Regex**: Pattern matching for syntax transformation
- **WalkDir**: Recursive directory traversal
- **Colored**: Terminal output styling

The conversion pipeline follows a clean architecture:

1. **Discovery**: Recursively find all `.md` files
2. **Processing**: For each file:
   - Read content
   - Convert frontmatter
   - Transform admonitions
   - Preserve structure
3. **Output**: Write `.qmd` files with copied assets

## Current Limitations

While Doc2Quarto handles the most common conversion scenarios, be aware of these limitations:

:::: {.callout-warning}
## Known Limitations

- Content between admonitions and frontmatter is preserved as-is
- Custom Docusaurus components are not converted
- MDX features are not supported
- This is a one-time migration tool, not a continuous sync solution
::::

## Post-Migration Checklist

After running Doc2Quarto, follow these steps:

1. **Review Generated Files**: Spot-check a few `.qmd` files to ensure conversion quality
2. **Test Rendering**: Run `quarto preview` on your new documentation
3. **Check References**: Verify internal links and image references work correctly
4. **Update Configuration**: Create or update your `_quarto.yml` configuration file
5. **Customize**: Add Quarto-specific features like citations, cross-references, or executable code blocks

## Future Roadmap

The project has exciting features planned:

- [ ] Support for additional frontmatter fields
- [ ] MDX component detection with migration warnings
- [ ] Dry-run mode for preview before conversion
- [ ] Configuration file support for custom transformations
- [ ] Parallel processing for large documentation sets
- [ ] Extended platform support (Windows, additional Linux distros)
