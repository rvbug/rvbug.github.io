## Why I Made the Switch

After months of wrestling with Docusaurus integration for blogging on [qubitai.in](https://qubitai.in), I found myself spending more time managing configurations than actually writing content. Don't get me wrong—Docusaurus is a fantastic tool for documentation-heavy projects. But for a scientific blog with code outputs, mathematical equations, and research-oriented content? It felt like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

<!-- truncate -->

Enter **Quarto**.

When I started working on my research paper on [qfey.in](https://qfey.in/qpapers-published/), I decided to give Quarto a shot. Within hours, I was trying out beautiful, reproducible content with embedded code execution, stunning visualizations, and zero configuration headaches. The difference was night and day.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Think of it as the spiritual successor to R Markdown, but supercharged and language-agnostic. Whether you're working with Python, R, Julia, or Observable JS, Quarto has you covered.

At its core, Quarto transforms plain text (Markdown) into:

- **Websites and blogs** (like this one!)
- **Books and manuscripts** (multi-chapter, professional layouts)
- **Scientific papers** (with proper citations and cross-references)
- **Presentations** (RevealJS slides)
- **Dashboards** (interactive data displays)

The magic? You write once in Markdown, and Quarto handles the rest—including executing your code and embedding the results directly in your output.

## Why Quarto Over Docusaurus (and Others)?

### The Docusaurus Dilemma

Docusaurus excels at what it's designed for: React-based documentation sites with versioning, localization, and interactive components. But here's where it fell short for my needs:

1. **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple config files, plugin management, and React component setup felt overwhelming for simple blog posts.
2. **Code Execution**: No native support for running code and displaying outputs. You're limited to syntax highlighting.
3. **Scientific Writing**: LaTeX equations work, but integrating computational outputs requires workarounds.
4. **Build Overhead**: Node modules, dependency management, and build times added friction to my writing workflow.


### The Quarto Advantage

**Simplicity**: Write Markdown, add YAML headers, done. No build system to configure.

**Computational Narratives**: Execute Python, R, or Julia code and embed outputs—plots, tables, data—automatically.

**Scientific Publishing**: First-class support for citations, cross-references, equations, and academic formatting.

**Multiple Outputs**: One source file → HTML, PDF, Word, ePub. Need a website *and* a PDF report? Write once, render twice.

**Performance**: Lightning-fast rendering with incremental builds. No node_modules bloat.

### What About MkDocs, Jekyll, or Hugo?

Let's quickly compare:

* **MkDocs** is excellent for documentation with Material theme, but lacks computational capabilities.

* **Jekyll** and **Hugo** are fast static site generators, but require external tools for code execution (like Jupyter).

* **Docusaurus** shines for developer documentation with versioning needs.

* **Quarto** is purpose-built for scientific, data-driven, and computational content while still being simple for general blogging.

## Getting Started with Quarto

### Installation

Quarto is surprisingly easy to install:

```bash
# macOS
brew install quarto

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install quarto

I use Neovim for writing my blog along with another plugin called "Zen mode". The setup is available in [quarto neovim](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/neovim.html)



#### Before ZenMode

![WithoutZen](img/neovim-b4zen.png)



#### After ZenMode


![WithZen](img/neovim-withzen.png)


Once you are ready, you can just run the following commands inside Neovim to activate and preview quarto document.

```bash
:QuartoActivate

:QuartoPreview
```


> Why I use CLI for writing blogs
This helps me to focus and write quickly and some other stuff will come here.



### Creating Your First Blog

```bash
# Create a new blog project
quarto create project blog my-blog

cd my-blog
```

This generates a project structure:

```
my-blog/
├── _quarto.yml          # Site configuration
├── index.qmd            # Home page
├── about.qmd            # About page
├── posts/               # Blog posts directory
│   ├── _metadata.yml    # Posts metadata
│   └── post-1/
│       └── index.qmd    # Your first post
└── styles.css           # Custom styling
```

### Configuration

Edit `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "My Scientific Blog"
  description: "Exploring data, code, and ideas"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.qmd
        text: About
      - href: posts.qmd
        text: Blog
    right:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/yourusername
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/yourusername
  
  page-footer:
    center: "© 2025 Your Name. Made with Quarto."

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
    code-fold: false
    code-tools: true
```

### Writing a Blog Post

Create `posts/quarto-demo/index.qmd`:

````markdown
---
title: "Visualizing Data with Python"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2025-10-19"
categories: [python, data-viz, tutorial]
image: "thumbnail.png"
---
````

## Introduction

Let's explore data visualization with Python and matplotlib.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)

# Create plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y1, label='sin(x)', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(x, y2, label='cos(x)', linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Trigonometric Functions')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

The beauty of Quarto? This code runs during rendering, and the plot appears in your blog automatically!


### Preview

```bash
# Preview locally
quarto preview

# Render to HTML
quarto render

```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Creating a Complete Website

Quarto isn't just for blogs. Here's a complete website structure:

```yaml
# _quarto.yml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site

website:
  title: "QubitAI"
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "Home"
        href: index.qmd
      - text: "Blog"
        href: blog.qmd
      - text: "Projects"
        href: projects.qmd
      - text: "Research"
        menu:
          - text: "Papers"
            href: research/papers.qmd
          - text: "Talks"
            href: research/talks.qmd
      - text: "About"
        href: about.qmd
```

### 2. Writing Books

```bash
quarto create project book my-book
```

Books get automatic chapter navigation, cross-references, and can output to PDF, ePub, or HTML:

```yaml
book:
  title: "Quantum Computing Fundamentals"
  author: "Your Name"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - quantum-basics.qmd
    - algorithms.qmd
    - references.qmd
```

### 3. Python Integration (Real Example)

Let me show you a practical example with data analysis:

```{python}

#| label: fig-analysis
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Random Variables"
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
normal_data = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)
exponential_data = np.random.exponential(2, 1000)

# Create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))

# Normal distribution
axes[0].hist(normal_data, bins=30, density=True, alpha=0.7, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
axes[0].set_title('Normal Distribution', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
axes[0].set_xlabel('Value')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Density')
axes[0].grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Add theoretical curve
x_range = np.linspace(normal_data.min(), normal_data.max(), 100)
axes[0].plot(x_range, stats.norm.pdf(x_range, 100, 15), 'r-', linewidth=2, label='Theoretical')
axes[0].legend()

# Exponential distribution
axes[1].hist(exponential_data, bins=30, density=True, alpha=0.7, color='lightcoral', edgecolor='black')
axes[1].set_title('Exponential Distribution', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
axes[1].set_xlabel('Value')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Density')
axes[1].grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Add theoretical curve
x_range_exp = np.linspace(0, exponential_data.max(), 100)
axes[1].plot(x_range_exp, stats.expon.pdf(x_range_exp, scale=2), 'r-', linewidth=2, label='Theoretical')
axes[1].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print(f"Normal: mean={normal_data.mean():.2f}, std={normal_data.std():.2f}")
print(f"Exponential: mean={exponential_data.mean():.2f}, std={exponential_data.std():.2f}")

```


The plot and printed statistics will appear directly in your rendered blog. No manual screenshots needed!

### 4. Cross-References and Citations

```markdown
See @fig-analysis for the distribution comparison.

According to @smith2023quantum, quantum computing will revolutionize cryptography.

## References

::: {#refs}
:::
```

Add a `references.bib` file:

```bibtex
@article{smith2023quantum,
  title={Quantum Computing Applications},
  author={Smith, John},
  journal={Nature},
  year={2023}
}
```

### 5. Interactive Elements

Quarto supports Observable JS for interactivity:

```{ojs}
// Generate random data
data = Array.from({length: 100}, (_, i) => ({
  x: Math.random() * 100,
  y: Math.random() * 100,
  value: Math.random() * 100,
  category: ["Quantum", "AI", "Data Science"][Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)]
}))

viewof threshold = Inputs.range([0, 100], {
  value: 50, 
  step: 1, 
  label: "Filter by value threshold:"
})

filtered_data = data.filter(d => d.value > threshold)

Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(filtered_data, {
      x: "x", 
      y: "y", 
      fill: "category",
      r: 5,
      opacity: 0.7
    })
  ],
  color: {legend: true},
  grid: true,
  width: 700,
  height: 500,
  marginLeft: 50
})
```


## Integrating Quarto with Existing Websites

This is where Quarto really shines for real-world scenarios.

### Scenario 1: Quarto Blog + Existing HTML Site

If you have an existing HTML/React/Vue site and want to add a Quarto blog:

```yaml
# _quarto.yml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: ../existing-site/blog  # Output to your site's blog folder

website:
  site-url: "https://qubitai.in"
  bread-crumbs: false
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "← Back to Main Site"
        href: "https://qubitai.in"
```

Your existing site can link to `/blog/` and Quarto handles everything there.

### Scenario 2: Embedding Quarto Output

Render Quarto to standalone HTML:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    standalone: true
```

Then embed in your existing site:

```html
<iframe src="/quarto-content/article.html" 
        width="100%" 
        height="800px" 
        frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

### Scenario 3: Custom Theme Integration

Match Quarto styling to your existing site:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: none  # Disable default theme
    css: 
      - ../main-site/styles.css
      - custom-quarto.css
    include-in-header:
      - ../main-site/header.html
    include-after-body:
      - ../main-site/footer.html
```

## My Migration Journey: Docusaurus → Quarto


### What Changed (for the Better)

**Before (Docusaurus)**:
- 10+ configuration files
- node_modules: ~500MB
- Build time: 45 seconds
- Markdown + MDX components
- Separate code blocks (no execution)

**After (Quarto)**:
- 1 primary config file (`_quarto.yml`)
- No dependencies folder
- Build time: 3 seconds
- Pure Markdown + YAML
- Live code execution

### Migration Steps

1. **Set up Quarto project**:
   ```bash
   quarto create project blog qscribe
   ```

2. **Convert posts**: Migrated Docusaurus MDX to Quarto QMD
   - Changed frontmatter format
   - Added executable code blocks where relevant



## Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Convert one blog post first. Test the workflow.

2. **Use VS Code**: Install the Quarto extension for syntax highlighting, preview, and rendering shortcuts.

3. **Leverage freeze**: For expensive computations:
   ```yaml
   execute:
     freeze: auto  # Only re-run when code changes
   ```

4. **Version control**: Commit source `.qmd` files, not rendered `_site/` directory.

5. **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions for automatic deployment:
   ```yaml
   name: Publish
   on:
     push:
       branches: main
   jobs:
     build-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
         - run: quarto publish gh-pages
   ```
   
:::{.callout-note}
I am working on an open source cli migrtation tool to help out with this conversion.
:::

## Real-World Use Cases

**Academic Research**: Publish reproducible papers with embedded analysis

**Data Science Portfolios**: Showcase projects with live code and visualizations

**Technical Documentation**: Books, tutorials, and API references

**Company Blogs**: Technical content with code examples (engineering blogs)

**Course Materials**: Interactive lessons with executable examples

## Conclusion

Switching from Docusaurus to Quarto was one of the best decisions for my technical blog. The simplicity, power, and focus on scientific publishing transformed my workflow. I spend less time fighting with configurations and more time creating content.

If you're running a technical blog, working with data, or publishing research, Quarto deserves serious consideration. It's not just a tool—it's a complete publishing system that respects your time and amplifies your content.

**Try it yourself**:
1. Install Quarto: `brew install quarto` (or download from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org)). 
2. Create a project: `quarto create project blog my-blog`. 
3. Write your first post. 
4. Preview: `quarto preview`. 


Four commands. Zero configuration overhead. Beautiful, reproducible output.

Welcome to the future of scientific publishing.
