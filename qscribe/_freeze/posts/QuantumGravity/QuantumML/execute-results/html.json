QML can speed up training and evaluation of ML models and, in turn, help develop new quantum algorithms. This blog is an introduction to QML.\n\n![alt text](img/intersection.png)\n\nSource code provided in this article is available in my [**Github repo**](https://github.com/rvbug/q-gravity/)**.**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Introduction\n\nRapid progress has been made in Quantum Computing to harness the law of [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) and the problems (NP or NP-Hard) that classical computers alone cannot solve, even with arrays of GPUs and TPUs at our disposal.\n\nThat being said, Quantum Computers is not going to replace classical systems any time soon but will coexist (for now). Companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Rigetti, D-Wave continue to make rapid progress to achieve quantum supremacy. [IBM Qiskit]((https://www.ibm.com/quantum)) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) even offer free but limited access to their Quantum devices.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe are still a few years away from making quantum computers commercially available so then why learn it now?\n\nUnderstanding Quantum Mechanics will take time; you need to gain knowledge of a lot of complex topics - a few laws of classical physics do not even hold true at the subatomic level.\n\nHere are some interesting facts of Quantum Mechanics:\n\n1\\> **\"Spooky action at a distance\"** is a famous quote by Albert Einstein when he found that one particle's behaviour affects the other even if they are separated by vast distances.\n\nImage Credit - [Futurism](https://futurism.com)\n\n\\![spooky action\\]![alt text](img/spooky.png)\n\n2\\> There is a famous [double slit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) experiment showing particle-wave duality i.e. light and matter sometime act as particles and at other time, as waves.\n\nImage Credit - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment)\n\n\\![Double-slit experiment - Wikipedia\\]![alt text](img/doubleslit.png)\n\n3\\> Quantum Computing could be one of the biggest breakthroughs ever known to mankind :-\n\n-   Speeding up drug development\n\n-   Solving complex optimisation problems\n\n-   Forecasting weather conditions with greater accuracy.\n\n4\\> Just to give you an idea of what it can achieve - it will take millions of years to find the prime factors of a **2048-bit** number using classical computers but with quantum computers, it can be calculated within minutes. There is an active research in the field of [Quantum Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography) and [Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) .\n\n### **Still not convinced?**\n\nWell, you will get to see our universe through a completely different lens, appreciate nature's grand design and our existence - realising how little we know about it!\n\n> Beauty of unknown...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nTo get started in QML requires knowledge of (but not limited to) :\n\n-   Quantum Mechanics\n\n-   Python\n\n-   Mathematics\n\n-   Deep Learning\n\nBut being `Passionate` alone will give you ***superpowers*** to digest these extremely complex topics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# PennyLane\n\nIn this article, we will use Xanadu's PennyLane for programming Quantum Computers. It is a cross-platform Python library that enables the training of quantum programs.\n\nPennyLane can connect to powerful ML frameworks like JAX, Pytorch and TensorFlow. It manages execution by passing information between classical and quantum computers.\n\nHere's how you can install PennyLane on a virtual environment:\n\n``` python\n# preferrably in a virtual env\n$> pip install pennylane\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Basics\n\nBefore we get to programming, here are some basics you should know.\n\n## Qubits\n\nIn classical computers a bit can be either in a 0 or 1 state.\n\nBut Qubits can not only be in 0 or 1 but can also be in both states simultaneously - this is known as [***superposition***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition)***.***\n\n## Bloch Sphere\n\nThe state of the qubits is represented using Bloch Sphere and it helps to understand the behaviour of quantum circuits and algorithms.\n\nImage Credit - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere)\n\n\\![Bloch sphere - Wikipedia\\]![alt text](img/bloch.png)\n\n## Gates\n\nGates helps us to manipulate the state of the qubits. Some gates can be controlled and adjusted like a tuning nob. The state of the qubits can be changed by rotating parametrised gates around the X, Y, and Z axes. **The rotation is explained using these formulas.**\n\n## Ket\n\nKet vector represents the state of a quantum particle and is denoted as:\n\nProgrammatically , it can be represented as an array as show below:\n\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\n\nk0 = np.array([1,0]) # ket 0\nk1 = np.array([0,1]) # ket 1\n\nk0, k1\n\n# output\n#(array([1, 0]), array([0, 1]))\n```\n\n## Quantum Neural Network\n\nEquivalent to creating a Neural Network for Deep Learning on classical computers, QML uses trainable quantum circuits which should be **differentiable**.\n\n\\![Quantum Circuit\\] ![alt text](img/QNN.png)\n\n> A function f(x) is said to be ***differentiable*** if a **derivate** exists for that function.\n\n# The Script\n\n#### Libraries\n\n``` python\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\n#### Device Definition & Quantum Function\n\n``` python\n# defining a vey simple circuit\ndev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1)\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef circuit(x):\n    qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)\n    qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)\n    qml.PauliX(wires=0)\n    qml.PauliY(wires=0)\n    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))\n```\n\n#### Visualizing Circuit\n\n``` python\nfig, ax = qml.draw_mpl(circuit)([0.543, 0.4])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713329626629/ec899477-097f-4068-80ae-592749078b51.png%20align=%22left%22)\n\n#### Cost & Gradient calculations\n\n``` python\n# Cost function\ndef cost(x):\n  return my_quantum_function(x)\n\n# uses automatic differentiation \ninit_params = np.array([0.011, 0.012], requires_grad=True)\nprint(cost(init_params))\n\n# initialise the optimizer\nopt = qml.GradientDescentOptimizer(stepsize=0.4)\n\n# ...\n#...\n```\n\n# Complete Script\n\nYou can find the entire script here - [**Github repo**](https://github.com/rvbug/q-gravity/)**.**\n\n``` python\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=1)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef circuit(x):\n    qml.RX(x[0], wires=0)\n    qml.RY(x[1], wires=0)\n    qml.PauliX(wires=0)\n    qml.PauliY(wires=0)\n    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))\n\nfig, ax = qml.draw_mpl(circuit)([0.543, 0.4])\nplt.show()\n\nresult = circuit([0.543, 0.4])\nprint(result)\n\nd = qml.grad(circuit, argnum=0)\nd([0.543, 0.4])\n\nfig, ax = qml.draw_mpl(circuit)([0.543, 0.4])\nplt.show()\n\ndef cost(x):\n  return circuit(x)\n\ninit_params = np.array([0.011, 0.012], requires_grad=True)\nprint(cost(init_params))\n\n\n# initialise the optimizer\nopt = qml.GradientDescentOptimizer(stepsize=0.4)\n\n# set the number of steps\nsteps = 100\n# set the initial parameter values\nparams = init_params\n\nfor i in range(steps):\n    # update the circuit parameters\n    params = opt.step(cost, params)\n\n    if (i + 1) % 20 == 0:\n        print(\"Cost after step {:5d}: {: .7f}\".format(i + 1, cost(params)))\n\nprint(\"Optimized rotation angles: {}\".format(params))\n```\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis blog gives a very basic information of QML and what the future might look like.
