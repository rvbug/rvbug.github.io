# Troubleshooting & FAQ

## 1. Common Issues

### ❗ `Sparse index directory not found`

Make sure you cloned it properly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index.git sparse-index
```

### ❗ 429 Too Many Requests

Solutions:

- Use an authenticated token:

```bash
CRATES_IO_TOKEN=<token>
```
- Reduce frequency of runs
- Let caches handle daily refreshes

### ❗ Failed to parse cache

Fix:

```bash
rm cache/index_cache.json
rm cache/crates_cache.json
cargo run -- -s sparse-index
```

### ❗ Resume not working

Use:
```bash
cargo run -- -s sparse-index --force-fresh
```


## 2. FAQ
### 💬 Why is the first run slow?

Because it fetches metadata for all crates depending on Ratatui.

Subsequent runs are extremely fast.

### 💬 Why isn’t my crate included?

Possible reasons:
It doesn’t depend on ratatui
It uses optional dependency incorrectly
It has only yanked versions with that dependency

### 💬 How often should I run this?

Daily or weekly.

### 💬 Will the JSON format change?

Minor changes are possible.
The schema chapter documents stable and unstable fields.
