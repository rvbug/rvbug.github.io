# Chapter 4 — Sparse Index Parsing

The crates.io sparse index is a massive tree of directories where each file
contains **line-delimited JSON**, one line per version.

## Example Entry

```json
{"name":"a-tui-tool","vers":"0.4.1","deps":[{"name":"ratatui"}],"yanked":false}
```

## What ratcrate-core Extracts

- Latest non-yanked version

- Dependency list → look for `"name"`: `"ratatui"`

## Algorithm Summary

- Walk the directory tree

- For each file:
  - Read line by line
  - Parse as JSON
  - Skip yanked versions
  - If any version depends on ratatui → track latest version
