# Chapter 1 — Origin of the Idea

The idea for **ratcrate-core** began while exploring the growing ecosystem around the Rust TUI framework **Ratatui**.

Despite hundreds of crates and applications using Ratatui, there was:

-   No central directory\
-   No easy way to search TUI apps\
-   No dashboard showing downloads, popularity, repositories\
-   No index of community examples\
-   No machine-readable dataset

So **ratcrate-core** was born.

## Goals

-   Discover all crates depending on `ratatui`
-   Enrich them with crates.io metadata
-   Cache results for fast incremental runs
-   Output a unified dataset usable by:
    -   `ratcrate-cli`
    -   `ratcrate-tui`
    -   `ratcrate-web`
