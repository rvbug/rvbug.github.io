# The `ratcrate-cli` Project

`ratcrate` is a highly efficient command-line interface (CLI) application written in **Rust** designed to be the primary tool for discovering, searching, and managing packages within the rapidly growing **Ratatui (Terminal User Interface) ecosystem**.

The project's goal is to provide developers with instant, terminal-native access to up-to-date crate information, bypassing the need to browse websites.

## Key Features

-   **Offline Access:** Intelligent caching ensures that data is only downloaded when stale (older than 1 day) or when a manual refresh is requested.
-   **Fuzzy Search:** Filter crates by name or description using the `-q, --query` argument.
-   **Interactive Selection:** Integrates seamlessly with the external **`fzf`** utility for interactive, searchable selection (`-f`).
-   **Statistical Breakdown:** Provides a clear summary of total, core, and community crates (`-t`).
-   **Configurable Display:** Supports both a default colorful list view and an optional structured table view.

# Getting Started and Usage

## Prerequisites

To build and run `ratcrate`, you must have the following installed:

1.  **Rust Toolchain:** Install Rust and Cargo via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2.  **fzf (Optional):** The fuzzy finder utility is required to use the interactive selection mode (`-f`). Install it via your operating system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install fzf` or `brew install fzf`).

## Building and Running

Clone the repository (or ensure the files are in one directory) and use Cargo to build and run the application.

\`\`\`bash \# Build and run the executable cargo run --release

# Run with a standard query

cargo run -- -q "widgets"

| Flag | Long | Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| `none` | `none` | `none` | Show top 10 crates |
| `-q` | `--query` | String | Search term to filter crates by name or description. |
| `-t` | `--total` | `none` | **Show total count** incld. Core vs. Community |
| `-l` | `--limit` | `usize` | Maximum number of results to display (default: 10). |
| `-r` | `--refresh` | `none` | Force re-download of remote data, bypassing the cache check. |
| `-c` | `--cache-info` | `none` | Display the cache directory and file path |
| `-f` | `--fzf` | `none` | Use `fzf` for interactive selection of a crate. |
| none | `--table` | `none` | Use the table view (requires compiling with the `table` feature). |
