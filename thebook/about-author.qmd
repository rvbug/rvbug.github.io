# About the Author

Hi, I’m **Rakesh Venkat** — a developer, researcher, and lifelong tinkerer who likes building tools that:

-   Automate away repetitive work\
-   Make it easier to explore ideas\
-   Give people nicer ways to learn from and navigate code

Most of the projects in this book revolves around:

-   🦀 **Rust** and terminal tools\
-   🧪 **Ratatui** TUIs (very meta)\
-   📚 **Documentation** and knowledge organization\
-   🧩 Small research & experiments that later become libraries or tools

I think of this book as a logbook of the systems I’m building and how they fit together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What I’m Trying to Do With These Projects

The broader goals behind these tools:

-   Build **high-leverage tools** that save time for other developers.\
-   Collect and organize knowledge (like the Ratatui ecosystem) so people don’t have to rediscover the same things repeatedly.
-   Treat documentation as a first-class artifact, not an afterthought.

`ratcrate-core` is one piece of that: a way to turn a noisy, low-level index into a structured, queryable view of an ecosystem.

Future projects like `ratcrate-cli`, `ratcrate-tui`, and `doc2quarto` are meant to build on top of that foundation.

## A Note to Future Me (and Future Readers)

This book is partly a gift to **future me**: so I can come back in six months, read a chapter, and instantly remember why I made certain decisions.

If you’re reading it as someone else:

-   I hope it helps you understand the design of these projects.
-   I’d love it if it inspires you to build your own tools, or contribute ideas and improvements.
