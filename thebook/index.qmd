# Documentation hub.

> This site collects Technical Docs, Architecture Notes, and Design Decisions for all my projects.

# How to Use This Site

-   Use the **sidebar** or the project cards below to jump into a specific project.\
-   Within each project:
    -   Start with the *Overview* chapter
    -   Then read Architecture / Workflow chapters
    -   Dive into Code Snippets, Testing, and Future Work as needed

This site is primarily written for **future me** — but if you’re reading it later\
as a user or contributor, I hope it gives you clear insight into how everything fits together

# Roadmap & Future Projects

This hub is designed to grow over time as more tools , research, libraries experiments appear.

Planned additions include:

-   🧪 Experimental tools automation, research, quantum computing etc\
-   🧰 Libraries or platform to enhance productivity\
-   🗂 More utilities on workflows automation

When a new project is created, it will get:

-   Its own folder (e.g. `new-project/`)\
-   Its own mini “book” of chapters\
-   A card on this page linking into its docs

# About Me

I’m **Rakesh V**, a developer and tinkerer who enjoys building tools that make it easier to think, automate, and explore ideas.

I maintain the projects in this “book”

If you’d like to know more about my background, how these tools came about, and how to support my work, see:
