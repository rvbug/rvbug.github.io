## 📦 What is `ratcrate-tui`?

**ratcrates** is a powerful and fast **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** application designed to help you discover and manage crates within the [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) ecosystem. It provides a seamless, terminal-native experience for navigating lists of libraries, viewing detailed statistics, and quickly finding the right package for your project.

Built entirely in Rust, `ratcrates` is an example of the clean and efficient TUIs you can build with `ratatui` itself.

### ✨ Key Features

-   **Instant Access:** Fast data retrieval using local caching, ensuring the application is responsive.
-   **Comprehensive Data:** Displays package name, description, version, downloads (total and weekly), repository links, and categories for every crate.
-   **Smart Filtering:** Quickly switch between showing **all crates**, **core libraries** only, or various filtered lists like **Top Downloads** or **Newest**.
-   **Vim-Style Navigation:** Use familiar keys like `j`, `k`, `Ctrl+d`, `Ctrl+u`, `g`, and `G` to move through lists.
-   **Interactive Command Mode:** Execute powerful search and filter commands using the `:` prompt.

### 🎯 Ecosystem Goal

The primary purpose of `ratcrates` is to make the rich collection of Ratatui-related crates more accessible and discoverable, promoting the adoption and growth of the TUI community in Rust.
