# Introduction

The Doc2Quarto utility is designed for straightforward command-line execution, requiring only the source directory of your existing Docusaurus documentation and a desired destination directory for the converted Quarto files.

# Prerequisites

Doc2Quarto is built with Rust and packaged as a standalone binary. After installation (e.g., via cargo install), the doc2quarto command will be available in your system's path.

# Command Syntax

The application uses the clap crate for argument parsing, defining two required arguments: `--source` and `--dest`.

The general command structure is:

``` bash
$> doc2quarto -s <SOURCE_DIR> -d <DESTINATION_DIR>
```

| Option | Long Name | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `-s` | `--source` | The directory containing your Docusaurus `.md` files (the source docs root). | `./my-docusaurus-docs/` |
| `-d` | `--dest` | The directory where the converted `.qmd` files will be written. This directory will be created if it does not exist. | `./quarto-book/chapters/` |
| `-h` | `--help` | Print help | `doc2-quarto —help` |
| `-v` | `--version` | Prints Version | `doc2quarto --version` |

# Example Execution

Imagine your Docusaurus files are in a directory structure like this:

```{markdown}
my-project/
├── docusaurus-docs/
│   ├── intro.md
│   └── guide/
│       ├── setup.md
│       └── images/
│           └── diagram.png
└── ...
```

To convert these files and place them into a new Quarto book structure:

``` bash
$> doc2quarto --source docusaurus-docs --dest quarto-book/docs
```

# During Execution

-   Validation: The tool checks that docusaurus-docs exists.
-   Creation: The destination directory quarto-book/docs is created.
-   Discovery: All .md files in docusaurus-docs are found recursively.
-   Conversion & Copying:
    -   docusaurus-docs/intro.md is converted to quarto-book/docs/intro.qmd.
    -   docusaurus-docs/guide/setup.md is converted to quarto-book/docs/guide/setup.qmd.
    -   The docusaurus-docs/guide/images/ folder is copied to quarto-book/docs/guide/images/.
-   A progress bar provides visual feedback on the conversion process for large projects:

``` bash
ℹ Found 25 markdown files
[✓] [########################################] 25/25 Processed: setup.md
Conversion completed!
```

-   The resulting Quarto files (.qmd) are then ready to be referenced in your main \_quarto.yml file.

# Example \_quarto.yml configuration

```{markdown}
project:
  type: book
book:
  title: "My Converted Book"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - docs/intro.qmd
    - docs/guide/setup.qmd # Reference the converted files
```

# Error Handling

Doc2Quarto includes checks for critical errors (as seen in main.rs):

If the source directory (-s) does not exist, the program will exit with an error.

If no .md files are found in the source directory, the program will exit.

The creation of the destination directory (-d) is handled gracefully; if it fails (due to permissions, for example), the program will report the error.
