## Introduction

`qbanner` is a simple yet powerful Rust library designed to display highly customizable ASCII art banners in command-line interface (CLI) applications. It uses a modern builder pattern, supports Unicode, gradients, and automatically adjusts to fit the user's terminal size.

### Key Features

-   **Builder Pattern:** Easy-to-use, chainable methods for configuration.
-   **Terminal Awareness:** Automatically detects terminal width for centering and resizing.
-   **Color & Gradient:** Support for standard ANSI colors, bright colors, and dynamic RGB gradients.
-   **Fonts:** Includes modern Unicode, classic Standard, and compact Small fonts.
-   **Fallback Logic:** Gracefully falls back to smaller fonts or plain text if the banner exceeds terminal width.
-   **Screen Management:** Option to automatically clear the screen before rendering.

### Installation

Add `qbanner` and its dependencies (if necessary, though `qbanner` bundles most of its needs) to your `Cargo.toml`:

\`\`\`toml

\[dependencies\]
qbanner = { path = "path/to/qbanner" } \# If developing locally
# qbanner = "1.0" \# If published on crates.io
owo-colors = "3.5"
terminal_size = "0.3"

\`\`\`

### Quick Start

The core of the library is the `Banner` struct, configured entirely through method chaining.

``` rust
use qbanner::{Banner, Color, Alignment};

fn main() {
    // 1. Simple, centered, cyan Unicode banner
    Banner::new("Welcome")
        .color(Color::Cyan)
        .alignment(Alignment::Center)
        .render();

    // 2. Banner with an RGB gradient and a subtitle
    Banner::new("DevOps")
        .gradient(vec![
            (255, 100, 0), // Orange
            (255, 0, 100)  // Pink
        ])
        .subtitle("CI/CD Pipeline v2.1")
        .render();
}
```
