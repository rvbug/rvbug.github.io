The appearance of the banner text is governed by the `Font` enum and the built-in fallback logic.

### The `Font` Enum

The `qbanner` library includes three embedded fonts, which are static arrays of strings defined in `font.rs`.

-   **`Font::Unicode` (Default):** Uses modern box-drawing characters (like `█`, `║`, `╗`). This is the recommended choice for a clean, bold look on modern terminals.
-   **`Font::Standard`:** Uses classic ASCII characters (`/`, `\`, `_`, `|`). Offers high compatibility but a more retro aesthetic.
-   **`Font::Small`:** A highly compact, 3-line ASCII font. Used primarily as a quick fallback when terminal space is limited.

### The Font Data Structure

All fonts conform to the `FontData` structure, which makes it easy to add new fonts.

\`\`\`rust pub(crate) struct FontData { pub height: usize, pub chars: &'static \[(&'static str, &'static \[&'static str\])\], }

Each entry in `chars` is a tuple: `("CHARACTER_KEY", ["LINE_1", "LINE_2", ...])`.

### 3. Terminal Fitting and Fallback

By default, `qbanner` attempts to ensure the banner fits the current terminal width.

#### `fit_to_terminal(self, fit: bool)`

If `fit` is `true` (default), the library calculates the banner's visual width (correctly accounting for multi-byte Unicode characters) and compares it to the terminal width.

#### `fallback_strategy(self, strategy: FallbackStrategy)`

If the banner is too wide, the `FallbackStrategy` determines how to handle it:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **Strategy** | **Description** |
| `FallbackStrategy::SmallFontThenPlain` | (Default) Tries the `Font::Small`. If it still doesn't fit, it prints the original text as a single line. |
| `FallbackStrategy::PlainText` | Immediately falls back to printing the original input text, without attempting a smaller font. |
